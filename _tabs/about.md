Jim Barnes is a husband, father of three, multi-instrument musician, history buff, avid New York Mets fan and a programmer. He studied History at the [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu) where he began a career in information technology as a student worker. Shortly after graduation, he was offered a full-time position within the Desktop Support department and has been working in the technology field ever since.

Jim began his programming journey writing automation tools for software deployment to desktops in C# .NET, eventually applying those skills to web applications at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu). Following several years of building and maintaining .NET Web Form and MVC applications, he took another position at UCF supporting WordPress and Django (Python) applications, helping to create and maintain UCF's Bootstrap based CSS Framework, developing a standard brand theme for WordPress, creating countless data integrations between various UCF systems and their websites, and developing and maintaining DevOps practices used widely across the university.

In addition to a continuing passion and interest in history, Jim is also an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy. In particular, the works of J.R.R. Tolkien and Brandon Sanderson are among his favorites, with references often showing up in his technical documentation or articles.
